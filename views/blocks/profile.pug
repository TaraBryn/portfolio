    p
        | Starting in tech, I went to school and got certified in network administration through CompTIA. 
        | I quickly obtained a job in tech support at a call center
        | and have been at that position for four and a half years as of December 2019. 
        | During that time, I advanced to tier 2 tech support, 
        | but felt I wanted to do more in the field of development. 
        | To that end, I've spent the last few months learning various web development tools, 
        | in addition to prior knowledge of programming.
    p The following is a list of skills I have picked up along the way:

        li InfoSec (helmet.js, bcrypt, santize-html/sanitize-html-react)
        li C# and VB.NET
    p After learning the above technologies, I have built this site from the ground up to demonstrate my skills.
